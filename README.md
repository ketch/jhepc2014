This repo contains everything used for my 2014 SciPy Conference entry to the John Hunter
Excellence in Plotting Contest.  This is joint work with Manuel Quezada de Luna.  The
entry won an honorable mention.

The data files in this repository are from data/code in https://github.com/ketch/effective_dispersion_RR.
After submitting this entry, I reran some of the simulations and created nicer plots with better data.
The improved plots can be found in the paper, at http://arxiv.org/abs/1309.6666.  The improved data
and scripts can be found in the reproducibility repo linked above.

The final version of the figure (used in the paper) is below.
